# Welcome to SciAgent

**SciAgent** is a modular agent framework that pairs large‑language‑model reasoning with a rich set of external tools.  It automates many of the repetitive steps involved in software engineering, scientific computing and research—such as reading and writing files, searching code, running shell commands, executing simulations and performing web queries—so you can focus on higher‑level problem solving.

## What you can do with SciAgent

* **Generate, debug and refactor code** across multiple languages using an LLM backed by file operations and shell execution.
* **Perform research and write documentation** by searching the web, reading files and summarising information.
* **Run scientific simulations** inside containerised environments for numerical computation, chemistry, optimisation, optics, fluid dynamics and circuit design.
* **Compose multi‑stage workflows** by breaking down large objectives into dependent tasks and delegating them to specialised sub‑agents.
* **Extend the framework** with your own tools, services and system prompts to suit your domain.
 

## Quick navigation

This site is organised into concise guides to help you get started and explore deeper topics:

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** | Install SciAgent, run your first task and learn the basic command‑line flags. |
| **[Configuration](configuration.md)** | Customise the model, system prompt, caching, tool registry and sub‑agents via the CLI or Python APIs. |
| **[Use Cases](usecases.md)** | Explore examples of how researchers and developers can leverage SciAgent in practice. |
| **[Architecture](architecture.md)** | Understand how the agent loop, LLM client, tools, context window, sub‑agents and orchestrators fit together. |
| **[Comparison with Other Frameworks](novelty.md)** | See how SciAgent compares to AutoGen, LangChain DeepAgents, OpenHands, and Aider. |
| **[Sub‑agents](subagents.md)** | Dive deeper into specialised sub‑agents and see how to create your own. |

If you are new to SciAgent, start with **Getting Started**.  Developers looking to customise the system should read **Configuration** and **Architecture**.  To understand how SciAgent can help in your projects, check out **Use Cases** and the **Novelty** page.
