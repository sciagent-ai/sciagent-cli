# Welcome to SciAgent-CLI

**SciAgent-CLI** is a modular agent framework that pairs large‑language‑model reasoning with a rich set of external tools, that runs from terminal.  It automates many of the repetitive steps involved in software engineering, scientific computing and research—such as reading and writing files, searching code, running shell commands, executing simulations and performing web queries—so you can focus on higher‑level problem solving.

## What you can do with SciAgent

* **Generate, debug and refactor code** across multiple languages using an LLM backed by file operations and shell execution.
* **Perform research and write documentation** by searching the web, reading files and summarising information.
* **Run scientific simulations** inside containerised environments for numerical computation, chemistry, optimisation, optics, fluid dynamics and circuit design.
* **Compose multi‑stage workflows** by breaking down large objectives into dependent tasks and delegating them to specialised sub‑agents.
* **Extend the framework** with your own tools, services and system prompts to suit your domain.
