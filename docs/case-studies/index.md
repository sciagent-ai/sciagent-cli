# Case Studies

Real-world examples of SciAgent reproducing scientific research from peer-reviewed publications.

---

## Overview

These case studies demonstrate SciAgent's ability to autonomously:

- **Read and understand** scientific papers (PDFs)
- **Extract parameters** and methodology from publications
- **Write working code** using domain-specific tools
- **Debug and iterate** through multiple code revisions
- **Validate results** against published data

Each case study shows the prompt given, the autonomous workflow, and quantitative validation of results.
