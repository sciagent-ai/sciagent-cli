"""
Domain specific tools for the SCI Agent.

This subpackage is reserved for tools that operate in a
particular domain (such as finance, healthcare, or data
science). By separating domain tools from core tools you can
easily enable or disable them based on the task context or
agent configuration. Additional folders may be created within
this subpackage (e.g. ``finance``) to group related tools.
