# Welcome to SciAgent

**SciAgent** is a modular agent framework that pairs large-language-model reasoning with a rich set of external tools, that runs from terminal. It automates many of the repetitive steps involved in software engineering, scientific computing and research—such as reading and writing files, searching code, running shell commands, executing simulations and performing web queries—so you can focus on higher-level problem solving.

## What you can do with SciAgent

This site is organised into concise guides to help you get started and explore deeper topics:

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** | Install SciAgent, run your first task and learn the basic command-line flags. |
| **[Configuration](configuration.md)** | Customise the model, system prompt, caching, tool registry and sub-agents via the CLI or Python APIs. |
| **[Use Cases](usecases.md)** | Explore examples of how researchers and developers can leverage SciAgent in practice, including a photonics case study. |
| **[Architecture](architecture.md)** | Understand how the agent loop, LLM client, tools, skills, context window, sub-agents and orchestrators fit together. |
| **[Comparison with Other Frameworks](novelty.md)** | See how SciAgent compares to AutoGen, LangChain DeepAgents, OpenHands, and Aider. |
| **[Sub-agents](subagents.md)** | Dive deeper into specialised sub-agents and see how to create your own. |
